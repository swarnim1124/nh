# 🦺 NH – Safety First Project  

Hi there! 👋  
This project is all about keeping people safe using simple computer programs.  
Think of it like a **superhero helper** that watches out for danger. 🚨  

## 🌟 Features  

### 1. 👷 Helmet Detection (`helmet.html`)
- This page checks if someone is **wearing a helmet**.  
- Why? Because helmets protect our heads. If you forget to wear one, the system will warn you!  

### 2. 👕 Safety Vest Detection (`helmet.html`)
- Along with the helmet, it also looks for a **safety vest**.  
- Vests make people **more visible**, especially in busy or dangerous places.  

### 3. 🤕 Fall Detection (`fall.html`)
- This page tries to find out if someone has **fallen down**.  
- Imagine if a worker slips — the system can alert others so they can help quickly.  

### 4. 🚗 Speed Check / Vehicle Log (`speed.html`)
- This page keeps track of vehicles coming in and going out.  
- It can also check if a vehicle is going too **fast**.  
- Helps keep roads and workplaces safe.  

### 5. 🏠 Main Dashboard (`index.html`)
- This is like the **home screen** of the project.  
- From here, you can go to each feature (Helmet, Fall, Speed).  
- It’s like the main menu of a video game! 🎮

## ⚡ How it works (in simple words)
- Each page has some smart code that looks at pictures or video.  
- The code acts like **eyes** 👀 that can tell if someone is safe or not.  
- If it sees danger (like no helmet or someone falling), it gives a warning.

## 🚀 Why this project?
Because safety is super important. Just like how your parents tell you to wear a helmet when you ride a bicycle — this project does the same, but using a computer! 🖥️💡

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.  
2. Click on the feature you want to try (Helmet, Fall, Speed).  
3. See how it works and learn about safety!

## 💡 Future Ideas
- Add **spill detection** (for water/oil on the floor).  
- Add **alcohol check** for workers.  
- Add more safety tools to make the system even smarter.

✨ Stay safe, be smart, and always wear your helmet!
